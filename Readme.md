# ü§ñ AI Modelling Frameworks Showcase ‚Äì Week 5

Welcome to the **AI Modelling Frameworks** gallery!  
This repository is a hands-on playground demonstrating how to deploy and interact with machine learning models using three of the most popular Python web frameworks: **Streamlit**, **Dash**, and **Flask**. Each mini-app brings a different flavor of AI to life‚Äîsentiment analysis, house price prediction, and image classification‚Äîall ready for you to explore, extend, and deploy!

## üö¶ What‚Äôs Inside?

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Streamlit: Sentiment Analysis App
- **File:** `Streamlit.py`
- **Tech:** [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) + [Hugging Face Transformers](https://huggingface.co/transformers/)
- **What it does:**  
  Instantly analyzes the sentiment of any text you enter‚Äîpositive or negative‚Äîusing a state-of-the-art transformer model.
- **How to run:**  
  ```sh
  streamlit run Streamlit.py
  ```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Dash: House Price Prediction App
- **File:** `Dash.py`
- **Tech:** [Dash](https://dash.plotly.com/) + [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
- **What it does:**  
  Predicts house prices based on historical data and various input features using a powerful machine learning model.
- **How to run:**  
  ```sh
  python Dash.py
  ```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Flask: Image Classification App
- **File:** `Flask/app.py`
- **Tech:** [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/) + [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/)
- **What it does:**  
  Classifies images into categories using a deep learning model trained on a large image dataset.
- **How to run:**  
  ```sh
  flask run
  ```

## üìö Learnings & Contributions

This week, we delved into the intricacies of deploying machine learning models with:
- **Streamlit:** Creating interactive web apps for machine learning projects with ease.
- **Dash:** Building analytical web applications with complex data visualizations.
- **Flask:** Developing lightweight web applications and APIs for machine learning models.

A big thank you to our contributors for their hard work and dedication! Let‚Äôs keep pushing the boundaries of AI and web development.
